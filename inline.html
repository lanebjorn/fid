<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am
extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i>
cooking you,
submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
plastic) into a water bath that is percisely set to
the target temperature you want the food to be
cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serv-
ing <i><b>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To
reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
November 30.</p>

cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you
are pregnant or have immunity issuses.</small></p>
