<p> This is my interpretation of a character's grief from a book. <i>Tian Guan Ci Fu</i> or Heaven Official's Blessing is a 1000-page monstrosity of romance, action, character development, and overall grief. This character, Hua Cheng (花城, Huā Chéng), devoted his life to the crown prince of his former kingdom and the main character, Xie Lian (谢怜, Xiè Lián), after Xie Lian saved his life. A series of horrific leads Hua Cheng to die and become a ghost and Xie Lian to ascend to the heavens and become a god. While Xie Lian represses the memories of tragedy and death in his life, Hua Cheng remains constantly aware of what happened to Crown Prince.</p>
<p> The eyes and body of Hua Cheng look manic as his body is coiled over the several statues of the Crown Prince. In the book, it is told he had carved hundreds of these statues to worship them, even though he could never get their faces right.</p>
<p> Overall, I'm proud of this painting, not for any merit. Though this was an experimentation of my layout abilities and style points, which I still like. But anyways, I am amazed by the fact I did this in 3 days. Those other paintings you have seen took me several months, but this took me three days and a few Kill Cliff energy drinks. And now, here it is for you to enjoy!</p>
