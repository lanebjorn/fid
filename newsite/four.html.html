<p> If you are unable to recognize him, this is Danny Elfman, <i>extremely</I> well-known composer and strange man, as well as the lead singer to the band Oingo Boingo. This is a screencap from the music video "Private Life." I just made this because I like the visuals provided in the video.</p>
<p> So here's what I like about it. I love the color palate, it looks a little bright in person, but overall I just ended up enjoying it. The second thing, the <i>texture</i></p>
<p> I have gotten several comments on how my paintings look fun to touch. They are. But this one, especially, is where those comments come from. The ridges and bumps of paint add a layer of texture and shadow which brings the whole thing together. Once again, this is also an early 2021 painting where I'm still figuring out what I'm doing, so I still think it's good, but the Doom painting is better, in some capacity.</p>
