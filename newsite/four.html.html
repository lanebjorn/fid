<p> If you are unable to recognize him, this is Danny Elfman, <i>extremely</I> well-known composer and strange man, as well as the lead singer to the band Oingo Boingo. This is a screencap from the music video "Private Life." I just made this because I like the visuals provided in the video.</p>
<p> So here's what I like about it. I love the color palate, it looks a little bright in person, but overall I just ended up enjoying it. The second thing, the <i>texture</i></p>

  <p> I heard she had gotten several comments on how her paintings look fun to touch. I bet they are. But this one, especially, is where those comments come from. The ridges and bumps of paint add a layer of texture and shadow which brings the whole thing together. Once again, this is also an early 2021 painting where she was still figuring out what she's doing, so I still think it's good, but the Doom painting is better, in some capacity.</p>
