<p> This is a painting of a level in the Japanese game <i>Dōkutsu Monogatari</i>, or Cave Story. A game released in 2004. The level is called "The Balcony"</p>
<p> The game is about a reconnaissance robot named Quote, sent to a massive floating island to find a group of missing scientists and their research. The story eventually
reveals that Fuyuhiko Date, a character called The Doctor, is the main villain. He was a part of the original research team who visited the island, but he found a magical artifact in the form of a red crystal. With that crystal, it allowed him to control the island.</p>

<P> The Balcony is the final level before the 1st final boss, The Doctor. It contains a slow, calm background track with minimal enemies and several healing items.</p>
<p> What makes this one of my favorite paintings is the beauty of the color and the music that inspired it. The sky is a mix of deep purple and yellow, and I was at first hesitant to mix the two, only for it to create a delightful gradient. I made a few mistakes, but I am very proud of my shadows and color variation.</p>
