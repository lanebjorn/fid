<p> This painting is based on a horror podcast's characters. The podcast, titled <i>The Hotel</i>, is a serialized podcast based around the miserable lives of The Manager, The Owner, and The Lobby Boy, who is the subject of the painting (in the more recent seasons, some other characters have joined the cast, but I don't know them!). These three are zombies trapped in a hotel that draws humans to consume in unique death traps that relate to the backstories of these human characters each episode is named after.</p>
<p>This scene, in particular, occurs at the end of the third season. A monster has been breaking into the hotel and tearing its inhabitants to pieces (specifically The Manager, who the lobby boy is very <i>fond</I> of). In a desperate attempt to escape the creature, the Lobby Boy runs into a hotel room and locks the door, only for it to burst into flames, ending his life. However, due to this podcast being based around existential horror, he continues to relive his end, as you can see in the painting.</p>
<p> I like this painting so much because of the color and comments I got on it. The podcast creator is very fond of fan art and often reposts it for others to see. What got me was that the person who got me into the podcast (an artist I have followed since very early high school) liked the piece. Which made my day. And whenever I look at the painting, I can't help but smile, despite the horrific context.</p>
