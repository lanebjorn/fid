<p> This is a painting inspired by the viral 2020 game <i>Doom Eternal</i>. The story of these games, about the prequel <i>Doom</I> 2016, absolutely enthralled me. You might be thinking...</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes! Really! After being locked in my house for several months, the story of an insane woman summoning infernal creatures on Mars that inevitably causes the destruction of a pseudo-religious civilization of massive angelic aliens is a good time. Not to mention, I love metal music, and it is the entire soundtrack.</P>
<p>But about the painting. This was the first of my 2021 summer of painting, and it's my experimentation with starting painting again. Before this, I just painted for school, but this was an attempt to see how my style developed over the years. Of course, the Doom guy in the center looks messy, but the gargoyles (creatures in the background) are my favorite. This was when I got into smearing and making abstract forms with my paint, not to mention this was when I discovered I like limited color palettes.<small>(keep this in mind.)</small></p>
<p>I think I have definitely improved. But I think this still holds up after 2 and 1/2 years.</p>
