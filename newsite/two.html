<p> I made this painting for my 11th-grade AP Drawing class. My theme, you had to make around ten drawings based on a unique and personal theme, was a complicated introspection into loneliness and my enjoyment of romantic fiction in combination. The majority of these characters are from a dream. Specifically, the man at the top is a prominent part of a dream I had in 2020. It was extraordinary; I can only say he was a ghost.</p>
<p> I like this painting because I went all out, considering how much clay and modge podge I used. That is my proudest achievement because I just did it to make a statement and wanted to do something fun because the due date was rapidly approaching.</p>
<p> This painting will always be one of my favorites because out of all the years, I have gone to school and taken art classes, this is the one painting that the art teacher enjoyed and did not just look over while she graded them. I know it's from a few years ago; it's falling apart. But it is the proudest moment in my academic career</p>
