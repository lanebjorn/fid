<p> I think she made this painting for her 11th-grade AP Drawing class. Her theme, you make around ten drawings based on a unique and personal theme, was a complicated introspection into loneliness and my enjoyment of romantic fiction in combination. The majority of these characters are from a dream. Specifically, the man at the top is a prominent part of a dream I had in 2020. It was extraordinary; I can only say he was a ghost.</p>
<p> I like this painting because she went all out, considering how much clay and modge podge she used. She always talks about it being her proudest achievement because she just did it to make a statement and wanted to do something fun because the due date was rapidly approaching.</p>
<p> This painting will always be one of my favorites because out of all the years, she said out of all of the years she had gone to school and taken art classes, this is the one painting that the art teacher enjoyed and did not just look over while she graded them.</p>
